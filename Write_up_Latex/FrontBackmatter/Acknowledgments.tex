Similarly I want to thank Kevin for his expert advice and other colleagues, particularly those within the array team at the Viapath Genetics Laboratories for their help and support which helped make this project so enjoyable.

I'd also like to thank the 2013 STP cohort for being so supportive and forming such a tight and responsive network to help address the many obstacles encountered along the way.

Finally I'd like to thank Sonia for her support through this project and the last three years in general.
