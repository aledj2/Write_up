\section{Further analysis of the low coverage of the 750 probe deletion on chromosome 22}\label{ch:analysisof22del}
At a threshold of 3.55 all calls from samples with the chromosome 22 deletion were made within the 73 probe region (Table  \ref{tab:chr22delcalls}).


\begin{table}[h]

\caption[Test cases: The calls made on the arrays made from the cases with the 750 probe deletion on chromosome 22]{Test cases: At a threshold of 3.55 all calls made on the arrays made from the cases with the 750 probe deletion on chromosome 22 were within a 73 probe section (probes 39733 to 39805). Of these 73 probes between 17\% and 74\% were covered by a call.}
