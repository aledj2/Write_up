\paragraph*{}
SID is capable of processing raw feature extraction files, and by analysing each hybridisation partner independently identify CNV present in both hybridisation partners. 
\paragraph*{}
A call was identified within the known CNV in 100\% of the 69 cases manually created true positive cases.
\paragraph*{}
A number of calls outside these regions were also identified which may be false positive calls or true shared CNV within a common CNV region. An indication for the prevalence of these calls was shown in 121 prospective arrays.
\paragraph*{}
The long term management of SID and further work required before SID can be implemented in clinical service has been detailed, including a strategy for analysing the sex chromosomes and migrating SID to the departmental server. The departmental LIMS system must be modified and link to SID created to capture shared CNV.
