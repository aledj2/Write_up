\paragraph*{}
In line with the requirements set out in chapter \ref{Requirements} SID is capable of processing raw feature extraction files, and by analysing each hybridisation partner independently identify CNV present in both hybridisation partners. 
\paragraph*{}
Calls were identified within the known CNV in 100\% of the 69 cases manually created true positive cases.
\paragraph*{}
A number of calls outside these regions were also identified which may be false positive calls or true shared CNV within a common CNV region. An indication for the prevalence of these calls was shown in 121 prospective arrays.
\paragraph*{}
However before SID can be implemented within the clinical service further work is required. These steps have been detailed, including a strategy for analysing the sex chromosomes and migrating SID to the departmental server. Both SID and the departmental LIMS system must be modified to enable shared CNV to be reported to the clinical scientist.
\paragraph*{}
Aspects for the long term management of SID were also discussed.
