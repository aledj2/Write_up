Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization {(CGH)} can reveal chromosomal aberrations in the genomic {DNA.} These amplifications and deletions at the {DNA} level are important in the pathogenesis of cancer and other diseases. While a large number of approaches have been proposed for analyzing the large array {CGH} data sets, the relative merits of these methods in practice are not clear.

Results:
We compare eleven different algorithms for analyzing array {CGH} data. These include both segment detection methods and smoothing methods, based on such diverse techniques as mixture models, Hidden Markov Models, maximum likelihood, regression, wavelets, genetic algorithms, and others. We compute the Receiver Operating Characteristic {(ROC)} curves using simulated data to quantify sensitivity and specificity for various levels of signal-to-noise ratio and different sizes of abnormalities. We also characterize their performance on chromosomal regions of interest in a real data set obtained from patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme. While comparisons of this type are difficult due to possibly sub-optimal choice of parameters in the methods, they nevertheless reveal general characteristics that are helpful to the biological investigator.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Array comparative genomic hybridization {(CGH)} allows detection and mapping of copy number of {DNA} segments. A challenge is to make inferences about the copy number structure of the genome. Several statistical methods have been proposed to determine genomic segments with different copy number levels. However, to date, no comprehensive comparison of various characteristics of these methods exists. Moreover, the segmentation results have not been utilized in downstream analyses.
Results: We describe a comparison of three popular and publicly available methods for the analysis of array {CGH} data and we demonstrate how segmentation results may be utilized in the downstream analyses such as testing and classification, yielding higher power and prediction accuracy. Since the methods operate on individual chromosomes, we also propose a novel procedure for merging segments across the genome, which results in an interpretable set of copy number levels, and thus facilitate identification of copy number alterations in each genome.

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION:} Array {CGH} technologies enable the simultaneous measurement of {DNA} copy number for thousands of sites on a genome. We developed the circular binary segmentation {(CBS)} algorithm to divide the genome into regions of equal copy number. The algorithm tests for change-points using a maximal t-statistic with a permutation reference distribution to obtain the corresponding P-value. The number of computations required for the maximal test statistic is {O(N2)}, where N is the number of markers. This makes the full permutation approach computationally prohibitive for the newer arrays that contain tens of thousands markers and highlights the need for a faster algorithm.
{RESULTS:} We present a hybrid approach to obtain the P-value of the test statistic in linear time. We also introduce a rule for stopping early when there is strong evidence for the presence of a change. We show through simulations that the hybrid approach provides a substantial gain in speed with only a negligible loss in accuracy and that the stopping rule further increases speed. We also present the analyses of array {CGH} data from breast cancer cell lines to show the impact of the new approaches on the analysis of real data.
{AVAILABILITY:} An R version of the {CBS} algorithm has been implemented in the {"DNAcopy"} package of the Bioconductor project. The proposed hybrid method for the P-value is available in version 1.2.1 or higher and the stopping rule for declaring a change early is available in version 1.5.1 or higher.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2885406/},
	doi = {10.1186/1755-8166-3-9},
	abstract = {Background
Several studies have demonstrated that array comparative genomic hybridisation {(CGH)} for genome-wide imbalance provides a substantial increase in diagnostic yield for patients traditionally referred for karyotyping by G-banded chromosome analysis. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of and strategies for, the use of array {CGH} in place of karyotyping for genome imbalance, and to report on the results of the implementation of this approach.

Results
Following a validation period, an oligoarray platform was chosen. In order to minimise costs and increase efficiency, a patient/patient hybridisation strategy was used, and analysis criteria were set to optimise detection of pathogenic imbalance. A customised database application with direct links to a number of online resources was developed to allow efficient management and tracking of patient samples and facilitate interpretation of results. Following introduction into our routine diagnostic service for patients with suspected genome imbalance, array {CGH} as a follow-on test for patients with normal karyotypes (n = 1245) and as a first-line test (n = 1169) gave imbalance detection rates of 26\% and 22\% respectively (excluding common, benign variants). At least 89\% of the abnormalities detected by first line testing would not have been detected by standard karyotype analysis. The average reporting time for first-line tests was 25 days from receipt of sample.

Conclusions
Array {CGH} can be used in a diagnostic service setting in place of G-banded chromosome analysis, providing a more comprehensive and objective test for patients with suspected genome imbalance. The increase in consumable costs can be minimised by employing appropriate hybridisation strategies; the use of robotics and a customised database application to process multiple samples reduces staffing costs and streamlines analysis, interpretation and reporting of results. Array {CGH} provides a substantially higher diagnostic yield than G-banded chromosome analysis, thereby alleviating the burden of further clinical investigations.},

	abstract = {Background
Array {CGH} is widely used in cytogenetics centres for postnatal constitutional genome analysis, and is now recommended as a first line test in place of G-banded chromosome analysis. At our centre, first line testing by oligonucleotide array {CGH} for all constitutional referrals for genome imbalance has been in place since June 2008, using a patient vs patient hybridisation strategy to minimise costs.

Findings
Out of a total of 13,412 patients tested with array {CGH}, 8,794 (66\%) had array {CGH} as the first line test. Referral indications for this first line group ranged from neonatal congenital anomalies through to adult neurodisabilities; 25\% of these patients had {CNVs} either in known pathogenic regions or in other regions where imbalances have not been reported in the normal population. Of these {CNVs}, 46\% were deletions or nullisomy, 53\% were duplications or triplications, and mosaic imbalances made up the remainder; 87\% were {{\textless}5Mb} and would likely not be detected by G-banded chromosome analysis. For cases with completed inheritance studies, 20\% of imbalances were de novo.

Conclusions
Array {CGH} is a robust and cost-effective alternative to traditional cytogenetic methodology; it provides a higher diagnostic detection rate than G-banded chromosome analysis, and adds to the sum of information and understanding of the role of genomic imbalance in disease. Use of novel hybridisation strategies can reduce costs, allowing more widespread testing.},
